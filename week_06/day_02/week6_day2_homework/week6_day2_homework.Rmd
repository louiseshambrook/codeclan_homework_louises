```{r}
library(prob)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

Load data
```{r}
shopping_data <- read_csv("20190928-items.csv")
```

Question 1.
Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.
```{r}
clean_names(shopping_data)

summary(shopping_data)
glimpse(shopping_data)
head(shopping_data)
```

Question 2.
Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset.
```{r}
shopping_data %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(number_of_phones = sum(n())) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_phones)) %>%
  slice(1)
```
```{r}
samsung_data <- shopping_data %>%
  select(asin, brand, rating, totalReviews) %>%
  filter(brand == "Samsung")
```


Subquestions, following notes from David in the chat

Calculate: mean of the ratings (of that brand?)
```{r}
summary(samsung_data)
# - shows that the mean is 3.573

samsung_data %>%
  summarise(mean_ratings = mean(rating))
# confirms this, - calculates the mean as 3.5733

mean = 3.5733
```

Calculate: range
```{r}
samsung_data %>%
  summarise(max_rating = max(rating),
            min_rating = min(rating),
            range = max(rating) - min(rating))

range = 4

```

Calculate: standard deviation
```{r}
samsung_data %>%
  summarise(standard_deviation = sd(rating))

SD = 0.6847859	

```

Question 3.
For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?
Hint: You will need to calculate the mean() and sd() of the ratings to plot the appropriate normal distribution. Alternatively, investigate using the fitdistr() function in the MASS package]
```{r}
# to find the answer for the density, look under 5.1 in the notes
# to fit the ND, look under 5.4




```

Question 4.
We can be more quantitative in comparing the distribution of top brand ratings with a normal distribution. You calculated the mean() and sd() of your distribution in an earlier question. Use these values to calculate the proportions of ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean. Compare these proportions with those you expect for a normal distribution.
Hint
You can use a filter() to get only the ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean, and then think about how to calculate what proportion each of these filtered sets make of the total number of ratings. Youâ€™ll need to use three separate filter() and summarise() pipes to do this.
Further hint - code to filter within one SD 
```{r}
