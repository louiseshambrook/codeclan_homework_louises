```{r}
library(prob)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

Load data
```{r}
shopping_data <- read_csv("20190928-items.csv")
```

Question 1.
Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.
```{r}
clean_names(shopping_data)

summary(shopping_data)
glimpse(shopping_data)
head(shopping_data)
```

Question 2.
Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset.
```{r}
shopping_data %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(number_of_phones = sum(n())) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_phones)) %>%
  slice(1)
```
```{r}
samsung_data <- shopping_data %>%
  select(asin, brand, rating, totalReviews) %>%
  filter(brand == "Samsung")
```


Subquestions, following notes from David in the chat

Calculate: mean of the ratings (of that brand?)
```{r}
summary(samsung_data)
# - shows that the mean is 3.573

samsung_data %>%
  summarise(mean_ratings = mean(rating))
# confirms this, - calculates the mean as 3.5733

mean = 3.5733
```

Calculate: range
```{r}
samsung_data %>%
  summarise(max_rating = max(rating),
            min_rating = min(rating),
            range = max(rating) - min(rating))

range = 4

```

Calculate: standard deviation
```{r}
samsung_data %>%
  summarise(standard_deviation = sd(rating))

SD = 0.6847859	

```

Question 3.
For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?
Hint: You will need to calculate the mean() and sd() of the ratings to plot the appropriate normal distribution. Alternatively, investigate using the fitdistr() function in the MASS package]
```{r}
# to find the answer for the density, look under 5.1 in the notes

# type - continuous numerical?

# fitting normal distribution
samsung_data %>%
  select(rating) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), col = "white", bins = 25) +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm, 
    args = list(
      mean = 3.5733,
      sd = 0.6847859),
    col = "red"
  ) +
  plot(d, main="Density of ratings") +
  polygon(d, col="red", border="blue") 

# cumulative density function
#??
 
# response to question
# No. To me, it looks like the rating(s) at 1 and 5 are distorting it too much,
# and that the fitted normal distribution does not take the peak enough into
# account. I feel that the density looks more like I would expect.
```


Question 4.
We can be more quantitative in comparing the distribution of top brand ratings with a normal distribution. You calculated the mean() and sd() of your distribution in an earlier question. Use these values to calculate the proportions of ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean. Compare these proportions with those you expect for a normal distribution.
Hint
You can use a filter() to get only the ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean, and then think about how to calculate what proportion each of these filtered sets make of the total number of ratings. Youâ€™ll need to use three separate filter() and summarise() pipes to do this.
Further hint - code to filter within one SD 
```{r}
#proportion within 1 sd
samsung_data %>%
  filter(rating >= 2.888514 & rating <= 4.258086) %>%
  summarise(proportion_of_total = sum(n()) / 397)
#.79 - better than .68

# proportion within 2 sd
samsung_data %>%
  filter(rating >= 2.203728 & rating <= 4.942872) %>%
  summarise(proportion_of_total = sum(n()) / 397)
#.919 - checks out

# proportion within 3sd
samsung_data %>%
  filter(rating >= 1.518942 & rating <= 5.627658) %>%
  summarise(proportion_of_total = sum(n()) / 397)

#.979 - checks out

#notes - the relevant sd distances
# one_sd_away = 2.888514
# one_sd_away = 4.258086
# 
# two_sd_away = 2.203728
# two_sd_away = 4.942872
# 
# three_sd = 1.518942
# three_sd = 5.627658
